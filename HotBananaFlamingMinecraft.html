      <p>I was inspired by a woodland mansion thinking that they should have more evokers.
        At that time I was also thinking about how much I hate Vex's. Those little demons.
        I made this mansion having <h4>Evokers, Vindicators, Illagers, Ravagers, and Witches</h4>
        leaving it really tough. I once tried it letting a lot of mobs out. With full netherite armor and tools
        I couldn't get inside. I dare you to try it.

      <p>All that trouble and i didn't get to find the elder gaurdian. I saw it but no fight. For all future gaurdian fights (I dont mean elder gaurdians) avenge me. I only found one other one (temple).</p>
